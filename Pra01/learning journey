CP3402 Week 1 Reflection
1. Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I decided that my startup theme would be my own guitar studio.
After that, I created a preliminary design for my website, which included three pages: home, about, and contact. 
In fact, my expectation is to create five web pages, because there is also a classes section and a Buy section, in order to provide customers with more complete services.

In this process, I initially reviewed the content of CP1406 from LearnJCU. 
This involved a review of fundamental HTML file structure and the insertion of images. 
Subsequently, I learned how to utilise CSS files to regulate HTML files from these sources. 
The following are the materials and links I have consulted
(some of which are Chinese websites, as my English proficiency is not particularly strong and I can comprehend them more effectively when reading Chinese).

The following website offers a comprehensive introduction to CSS: https://www.runoob.com/html/html-css.html. 
Another useful resource is https://www.w3school.com.cn/cssref/pr_background-size.asp, 
which provides detailed information on background size.

2. Estimated Hours
In total, I probably spent at least seven hours on practical tasks this week.
The time spent on this task was distributed as follows: approximately four hours were spent modifying my own web page, 
while approximately three hours were spent browsing materials and studying.

3. Content Insights: The Guitar Studio Theme
I found this introduction to WordPress theme creation to be an excellent resource.
It provided an overview of the underlying technologies, including WorldPress's use of PHP and MySQL,
and its release under a GPLv2 license, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution. 
Additionally, it introduced me to PHP, an open-source server-side scripting language that is widely used for server-side programming. 
Originally designed for web development, PHP can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP scripts are executed on the server to generate dynamic web content. 
In general, the prerequisite for using these tools well is to have a working knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and other related programming languages and technologies, 
as these will still be used. After studying these, I feel that my self-learning ability has improved somewhat and I also clearly understand how to complete some projects.

4. Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Upon completion of the initial week of practice, I commenced the investigation of educational resources pertaining to guitar studios,
sourced from online platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili. Prior to this, I anticipated that these resources would provide me with valuable insights and guidance. 
I did, however, learn some things that I did not think I would have learned otherwise. 
These included ideas for web pages and more advanced CSS writing techniques that I believe will be useful for creating more detailed websites in the future. 
This approach has proven effective. From this strategy to this week's study, I have concluded that this way of learning is useful, 
but I believe there are many parts that may be a waste of time. For instance, a video may be 30 minutes long, with only five minutes of content that may be of use. 
Therefore, it would be prudent to devise solutions to problems as they arise, ensuring that they are targeted and efficient.
